           	I am an 18 year old girl so of course I have a lot of projects. First, I want to finish my five year program at IESEG. Then, I want to do some law studies because my goal is to become a business lawyer. I also want to begin to horseride next year and I would like to lower my golf index to 10, I give myself about eight months.
